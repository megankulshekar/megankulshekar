## Hi, I'm Megan 👋

I am studying Computer Science at Colorado School of Mines. I have experience coding in Python, Java, and C++, and I am currently learning Javascript. My interests are in Human-Robot Interaction, Machine Learning, and front-end web development. I love attending hackathons where I get to learn new skills and frameworks!

Outside of coding you can find me:

- ✈️ Traveling and experiencing new cultures
- 🍜 Trying new foods and cuisines
- 📺 Watching the latest season of *Survivor* and *The Amazing Race*
